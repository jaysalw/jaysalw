While scrolling through the list of servers being sold in my local area, I came across what I would call an **epic deal**! A **Dell PowerEdge T330** with 8 Drive Bays (3.5"), and a Xeon E3-1270v, 32GB DDR4 RAM.

It comes with a base of 32TB (8*4TB), where the price would overall be cheaper than buying the disks elsewhere as well. Which - of course - is a wonderful deal. Shipping of around £10.50 approx. was fair as it weighs around 25-30kg when specs are at full.

Fun right? Well, I think so.

**Price before shipping** was £115.47
**Price after shipping** was £125.81

What a deal. Quite happy that I managed to **yoink** this!

In a nutshell, I want to show off my creations and it is pretty much a must-have for any personal website. Of course, I want GitHub to foot the bill of my site so my projects are stored within a JSON file (see https://github.com/jaysalw/jaysalw/blob/main/projects.json)

Simple right?

The site fetches the projects every 30 seconds and saves to memory as a cache. This does not use GitHub's API (like the Activity Heatmap does). Instead it requests the raw file and loads that to memory. Simple, yet effective.

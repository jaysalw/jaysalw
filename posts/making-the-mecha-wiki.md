The above image is my current design for the "Main Page" for the wiki. It uses a clean, yet easy to understand design (yet working with Dark and Light mode respectively). 

My testing wiki uses MediaWiki, and the Skin called "Citizen" (I've always **loved** that skin personally), and the overall design give it the community feel it really deserves. Nothing like the Big Tech support sites which get confusing fast and provide no real solution.

I spoke with the founder of Mecha, Shoaib, and so far the design seems great.

(please don't cry!)

I took inspiration from Google's Material 3 design scheme along with several aspects from other wikis such as the Star Citizen wiki (where the theme originates from).

I have also started designing other components to be used over the entire site such as the page summary card:

I have plans for other parts of the site such as an organised Extensions page for the Mecha Comet where it makes a grouped list of them all with filters??

Same for apps, and any optimised apps (where each app would have documentation on how to install, modify and enjoy).

Hopefully this goes somewhere! Who wouldn't want to contribute to their favourite community <3

If I have any updates on this I'll be sure to post them on my blog :), don't forget to have a look at the mecha comet: https://mecha.so

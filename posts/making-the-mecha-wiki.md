The above image is my current design for the "Main Page" for the wiki. It uses a clean, yet easy to understand design (yet working with Dark and Light mode respectively). 

My testing wiki uses MediaWiki, and the Skin called "Citizen" (I've always **loved** that skin personally), and the overall design give it the community feel it really deserves. Nothing like the Big Tech support sites which get confusing fast and provide no real solution.

I spoke with the founder of Mecha, Shoaib, and so far the design seems great.

(please don't cry!)

I took inspiration from Google's Material 3 design scheme along with several aspects from other wikis such as the Star Citizen wiki (where the theme originates from).

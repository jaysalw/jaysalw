This post will be pretty short, however here's the gist. I'll publish things I find interesting here!

This website is custom-made using **React** and **Node.js** - yes, I finally gave in (though just this once!). I wanted to play around with the technology of sorts and found it mildly interesting (obviously, otherwise we wouldn't be here right now).

### The domain name
Wow! That's pretty short hm? ``jay.fish`` - an amazing find right? I spent around 3 hours searching for a decent domain name under the premium price point of £40 or more. For example, one candidate was ``jay.zip`` which was £196/year. Bit steep for a personal website, right?

### Spotify & last.fm connection
I am using Spotify's Web API to show what I am currently playing, and then last.fm to fetch what I have previously played and how many times I have played said song.
